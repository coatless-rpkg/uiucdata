#' @details
#' As the R data file type allows for editing of the included data, we ask that
#' prior to using the files you accept responsibility for accurate dissemination
#' of this information and agree that no manipulation of the data that results
#' in falsification of the information will occur.
#'
#' Missing values contained within the data set are due to the
#' grade distributions not being displayed when a section has low enrollment or
#' when all students in the class have the same grade.
#' Because of the low enrollment in those classes or because all the students
#' in a class received the same grade, the grade data could identify a student.
#' Therefore, this data has been omitted to satisfy Family Educational Rights
#' and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. ยง1232g).
