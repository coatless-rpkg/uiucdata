\details{
As the R data file type allows for editing of the included data, we ask that
prior to using the files you accept responsibility for accurate dissemination
of this information and agree that no manipulation of the data that results
in falsification of the information will occur.

Missing values contained within the data set are due to the
grade distributions not being displayed when a section has low enrollment or
when all students in the class have the same grade.
Because of the low enrollment in those classes or because all the students
in a class received the same grade, the grade data could identify a student.
Therefore, this data has been omitted to satisfy Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. ยง1232g).

Please see the \href{https://registrar.illinois.edu/explanation-of-grades}{Grade Scale}
for details as to how the average GPA was calculated.
